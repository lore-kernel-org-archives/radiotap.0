Good point. However, not all hardware allows setting these with each
frame, the Broadcom hardware I work with most allows only setting up the
parameters for four access categories and then using them by putting the
frame into different DMA rings.

That makes sense.

Oh ok, that'd be perfect for those then.

That would work, although I think I'd still prefer being able to select
an AC as well because in most cases the queues would be set up according
to the four ACs. However, we can standardise that within the QNUM field
as well.

Definitely.

Sounds good to me as well.

Heh, probably.

Good point. However, in some cases where we may end up wanting to use
this feature, this means querying the kernel for the current
fragmentation threshold only to send it back into the kernel in the
radiotap header. That's perfectly acceptable of course.

Yeah, good enough.

Thanks for your comments! Do you want me to send a patch against the
authoritative version of the radiotap header?
