Yeah. I was too much in my little bubble when I wrote this. I just wrote
a lengthy reply to Marcel that explains a little more, but basically to
summarize:

Kernel drivers need to transport multiple data streams, like VoLTE (IP)
data, IP data, and control data. Currently, they do this in various ways
(cdc_mbim uses VLAN tags, rmnet/qmi_wwan uses Qualcomm QMI headers),
when you capture data you have to understand what you're dealing with
and maybe extend wireshark to even understand these headers.

I'm looking for a general vendor-agnostic encapsulation that would solve
this part of the problem.

At the same time, I come from WiFi, where - while we don't have these
sessions as such but can have different virtual interfaces as well, e.g.
for connections to different APs - it's often very useful to also
understand the PHY parameters that were used for TX/seen on RX. Now, I
realize this isn't something that modems will do right now - they just
don't seem to tell you any lower-level information on RX of a packet,
but it seemed like it might be worthwhile to not *exclude* this
possibility either.

Sure, but wifi is also not spoken over IP, yet we don't encapsulate our
802.11 frames into IP to show them in wireshark :-)

Sure.

This is the part I guess I don't understand. I haven't really tried, but
it seems you should be able to encapsulate arbitrary protocols into
802.3 OUI-based ethertype or so?

But I guess if your primary use case is actually to transport them over
the network, this makes more sense.

Our primary use case with wifi is much more local - capture what's going
on - but do the capturing on the local system and write it to a file
there.

Ok :-)

Right.

Yeah, I think here's where I got confused or just don't know enough
about GSM.

Basically, I was looking at it as if it was like WiFi in a sense - you
have an IP frame, you're going to transport it over some physical link,
so it gets PHY information in the sense of modulation etc.

That doesn't seem to be the case for GSM, I guess? Does the IP frame get
encapsulated in some kind of 3GPP message first, and then transported
over the physical link, and the physical link info isn't even there in
GSMTAP?

See above for a bit better description of what I'm trying to solve.

Sure. Just a note in passing.

I think you can pipe a stream into wireshark?

To me it feels like the wrong thing to actually make wireshark listen on
"lo" or "eth0" or something to get data from the cellular that's
(locally) generated by another application, but I guess that's only
about how you think about it - and if it's not generated locally then
that's an easy transport. I'm not sure it makes *sense* because then you
need permissions to capture on the wired network etc. where you don't
*really* need that for this stream, but it's convenient for sure.
