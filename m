Hi Johannes,

I'll only adress some of the points that haven't been clarified in other
mails in this thread alreasdy:

Agreed.  However, the protocol stacks on WiFi and cellular technologies
are very different, to say the least.  There is no easy mapping of PHY
related parameters to a given IP packet, and the related quality metrics
of the radio channels don't work that way.

But yes, I agree, that whatever transport mechanism you wan to use between the modem
and the user/Linux side should allow for additional, extensible metadata beyond
the identifier of the PDP/PDN context.

This is because your 802.11 implementations are in hardware, while the
open source GSM/UMTS/LTE implementations using GSMTAP are implemented in
userspace - or at the very least the higher-level parts of the protocol
stacks, or the tracing frameworks that are used to generate the GSMTAP
data from some hardware.

But why?  I'm in an userspace program, and I want to send data to one or
more other userspace programs.  Why would I not simply open a UDP socket
to do so?  I would have to have CAP_NET_RAW and open a packet socket,
and then generate ethernet frames from that?

I admit that the use case with wireshark is a bit odd, but there are
other receivers out there.

Also, for debugging cellular network elements, it's very useful if you
can look at the RAN or core network interfaces (Abis, Gb, Gp, A, Iu, S1,
...) in the same protocol trace in which you also get traces from the
radio interface in GSMTAP.  Then you can see what happens at each and
every interface / network element in one time-line.

And as the Osmcoom programs also allow generating log output wrapped in
GSMTAP, you get not only protocol traces of all the interfaces, but even
textual log information (with machine-readable log level + sub-system)
information all in one capture/timeline.

The use cases differ, but having UDP encapsulation enables a lot of
flexibility and has been proven very useful so far.

Yes, you're looking only at a single interface (the radio interface
between one BSS and one STA).  You're not looking at five different
interfaces at five different levels of network hierarchy/topology in the "wifi
controller" and want to mix in a radio interface trace in the same
timeline.

sorry. '... UDP based transport is ahat enables theis use case'

As stated elsewhere, there's an M:N mapping between user (IP) payload
and actual radio interface "MAC blocks", so I'm not aware of anyone
mapping radio interface performance to user plane IP.

the "physical link info" is present in GSMTAP, but the granularity of
GSMTAP frames is not user-IP frames, but "MAC blocks".  So your user IP
frame might not be visible as it's still compressed, encrypted,
fragmented, etc.

I admit it's a bit odd.  But has been very useful, particularly in more
distributed setups with creating a shared timeline of various GSMTAP
sources that may or may not run on the same machine.
